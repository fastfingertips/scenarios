scenario: "Before Creating an Account on a New Website"
description: "A comprehensive checklist for creating new online accounts, from verification and research to security best practices."
next_steps:
  - step: "Define Your Intent and Threat Model"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Before you start, ask: 'Why am I signing up and who am I protecting my data from?' Is this a low-risk forum or a high-risk financial service? Your answer determines how strict you need to be with the following steps (your OPSEC level)."

  - step: "Verify Site Authenticity and Security"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "1) Check the URL for typos (e.g., 'gogle.com' instead of 'google.com'). 2) Ensure the address bar shows a padlock icon and starts with 'https://'. 3) For an advanced check, scan the site with a tool like Mozilla Observatory; a low grade (D, F) is a major red flag."

  - step: "Research Alternatives and Make an Informed Choice"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Is this really the best tool for you? A few minutes of research can save you money, protect your privacy, or find a service that better fits your needs.
    
    How to research:
    - AI Search: Ask an AI engine (like Perplexity): 'Compare [Site A] vs [Site B] on privacy' or 'Best open-source alternative to [Site Name]'.
    - Community Feedback: Search Reddit or forums for '[Site Name] review' to find real, uncensored user opinions.
    - Comparison Sites: Browse AlternativeTo.net for a list of similar services.
    
    What to compare:
    Focus on Price, Features, and especially their Privacy Policy (is it Open Source?)."

  - step: "Check the Service's Data Breach History"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Use the 'Domain Search' on 'Have I Been Pwned' to see if this service has appeared in major data breaches. Also, search online for '[Site Name] data breach' for recent news."

  - step: "Check for an Existing Account"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "First, search your password manager (e.g., Bitwarden) for this site's domain. This is the fastest way to check. If nothing is found, you can also use the 'Forgot Password' link as a final check."

  - step: "Always Choose Manual Signup over Social Login"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "Avoid 'Sign in with Google/Apple/etc.' buttons. These link your accounts and share data between services. Always look for the 'Sign up with email' option to maintain separation (compartmentalization)."

  - step: "Choose Email Based on Your Intent (Long-term vs. Temporary)"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "Your email is your core digital identity. Match the tool to the task with this hierarchy:

    1. For ONE-TIME use (e.g., downloading a file, reading an article):
    - Use a DISPOSABLE email (like Temp-Mail.org).
    - Benefit: Quick, no spam, no connection to you.
    - WARNING: Never use this for a real account. You will permanently lose access.

    2. For MOST LONG-TERM accounts (shopping, forums, social media):
    - Use a MASKED/ALIASED email (like SimpleLogin, addy.io, Firefox Relay).
    - Benefit: Protects your real email from data breaches and spam. If an alias is leaked, you just disable it.

    3. For CRITICAL services ONLY (banking, government):
    - Use your REAL, PRIMARY email. This is your most valuable digital asset; guard it carefully."

  - step: "Choose a Unique and Anonymous Username"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Never reuse usernames from other services. A unique username prevents your activity on this site from being linked to your other accounts. Avoid using your real name or personal info."

  - step: "Generate a Strong, Unique Password"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "Your password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password) is your core security tool. Use it to its full potential:

    1. For Site Passwords: Let the manager generate a long (16+ characters), completely random password. A password you can't remember is a good password. This randomness, not just complexity, is what makes it strong against modern attacks.
    
    2. For Your Master Password: Your only job is to create ONE strong password for the manager itself. For this, use a memorable passphrase of 4-5 random words (e.g., `TreeSpoonBlueMountainPaper`). This is both highly secure and easier to type.
    
    Golden Rule: Never reuse passwords. If one site is breached, your password manager contains the damage, protecting all your other accounts."

  - step: "Provide Only Minimum Required Information"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Your goal: give the absolute minimum data required for the service to function. Less data shared means less data to be leaked, misused, or sold.

    1. Optional Fields: If a field is marked 'optional' or has no asterisk (*), always leave it blank.

    2. Required (but not critical) Fields: For required fields that aren't essential for the service (e.g., your real name for a forum, your birthdate for a newsletter), consider providing plausible but not real information. This tactic prevents them from building an accurate profile of you."

  - step: "Handle 'Free Trial' Payment Information"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "If a credit card is required for a trial: 1) Consider using a virtual card. 2) Immediately set a calendar reminder to cancel it a day before the trial ends."

  - step: "Look for and Uncheck Marketing/Newsletter Boxes"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "These are often pre-checked by default. Opt-out now to keep your inbox clean later."
  
  - step: "Check the 'Exit Strategy' (Account Deletion)"
    priority: "low"
    notes: "Can you truly DELETE your data, or just DEACTIVATE your account?
    
    1. Check Help/FAQ: Look for a 'delete account' guide. Is it a one-click process or do you need to contact support?
    2. Check Community: Search Reddit for 'how to delete [Site Name] account' to see real user experiences and complaints."

  - step: "Quick-Scan the Privacy Policy & ToS"
    priority: "low"
    notes: "This is the company's 'confession' on how they'll use your data. Look for these red flags:

    - Vague Language: Phrases like 'we may share with business partners' are a bad sign.
    - Third-Party Sharing: Do they mention selling/sharing data with 'advertisers' or 'data brokers'?
    - Outdated Policy: Is the 'Last Updated' date years old?
    - Keyword Search: Use Ctrl+F for your own search on 'sell', 'delete', 'arbitration'."

  - step: "Check for and Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)"
    priority: "high"
    notes: "This is your most critical defense after your password. A stolen password becomes useless to an attacker if 2FA is enabled.

    Security Hierarchy (Best to Worst):
    1. Best: Use an authenticator app (like Aegis, Ente) or a hardware key (YubiKey). This is the most secure method.
    2. Okay: Use email-based 2FA if app-based is not an option.
    3. Avoid if Possible: SMS-based 2FA. It's better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks."

  - step: "Isolate the Service in Your Browser"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "To prevent tracking across sites, contain this service. Use 'Firefox Multi-Account Containers' to assign it to a specific container (e.g., 'Shopping'). Alternatively, use a separate browser profile for this service."

  - step: "Archive the 'Welcome' Email"
    priority: "medium"
    notes: "Find the initial confirmation/welcome email in your inbox. Create a special folder (e.g., 'Account Registrations') and move it there. This email is proof of ownership and can be crucial for account recovery in the future."
